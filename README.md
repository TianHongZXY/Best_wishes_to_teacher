## Abstract 
The paper Happy Teachers’ Day to Prof.Yang (2020) yields state-of-the-art results in wishes modeling. However, the existing work needs more necessary implementation and multimedia presentation. Here, we further propose Happy Teachers’ Day to Prof.Yang (2021) with more active ways. In particular, we complete the simulation of the 1919 athletes' happy daily life under the guidance of Prof.Yang and make a video to celebrate Teachers’ Day for Prof. Yang. 

Thanks for Prof. Yang’s guidance and hard work, our group become more and more energetic, positive and united. For all the great things he say and do, we start and go far on the road of scientific research. In this special day, all the group members wish Prof. Yang happiness and prosperity. The code for our model is available at [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/Happy-Teachers-Day-To-Prof.Yang-Supplemental](https://github.com/jiyt17/Best_wishes_to_teacher)
